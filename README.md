I have created a simple *Guess my Number* game. It chooses a random number between 1 and 20 and then challenges the player to guess the number in 20 turns. After each turn the player is told if they are right or wrong. In the case that they are wrong, they are told whether the guess was too low or too high. The game ends once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player is given an option to start playing again and the highScore is recorded.

## Broken Down into **Actionble** Tasks :kissing_heart:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 20.
2. Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 20.
3. Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.
4. Next, check whether it is the correct number.
5. If it is correct:
- Display congratulations message.
- Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).
6. Player is able to restart the game.
7. If it is wrong and the player has turns left:
- Tell the player they are wrong.
- Allow them to enter another guess.
- Decrease the turn number by 1.
8. If it is wrong and the player has no turns left:
- Tell the player it is game over.
- Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).
9. Player is able to restart the game.
18. Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset, then go back to step 1.
